## Overview

Buddy Bot is an interactive chatbot with dynamic personality changes based on selected "temperature" moods. Users can adjust the bot's mood from freezing/grumpy to scorching/angry, with each state affecting both the visual interface and the bot's responses.

## Features

  - ðŸ¥¶ Freezing (Grumpy)
  - ðŸ˜° Cold (Uncomfortable)
  - ðŸ˜Š Comfortable (Happy - Default)
  - ðŸ˜… Warm (Restless)
  - ðŸ˜¤ Hot (Irritable)
  - ðŸ˜¡ Scorching (Angry)

- **Dynamic Visual Effects**:
  - Unique background animations for each mood (snow, rain, hearts, steam, fire, etc.)
  - Themed color schemes that change with mood
  - Animated particle effects

- **Personality Responses**:
  - Bot responses adapt to current mood
  - Different vocabulary and punctuation styles
  - Context-aware replies
